ðŸ”¥ Better OCR Engines (Offline)

- PaddleOCR
GPU acceleration (CUDA) â†’ much faster than Tesseract.
Excellent accuracy (often > Tesseract on complex layouts).
Supports multiple languages.
Actively maintained.

- EasyOCR
Also GPU-friendly, lightweight.
Accuracy is good, though PaddleOCR is usually stronger for structured PDFs.

- Calamari OCR
Focused on historical and difficult texts.
Uses deep learning models and can be trained on your own data.
Good accuracy, but setup is a bit more work.

âš¡ Optimizing Your Pipeline

Even with a better OCR engine, preprocessing PDFs is critical for speed + accuracy:

- Convert PDF â†’ Images smartly
Use pdf2image or poppler at ~300 DPI (higher = slower, lower = inaccurate).
If text is small, maybe 400 DPI, but benchmark performance.

- Preprocess with OpenCV
Deskew pages.
Binarize (Otsu threshold).
Remove noise / speckles.

- Normalize contrast.
Batch processing + multiprocessing
If youâ€™re using Python, parallelize page processing with multiprocessing.Pool or joblib.
If GPU, batch pages instead of single-image inference.

ðŸš€ Recommended Setup for You

Best balance (speed + accuracy, offline):
â†’ PaddleOCR (with GPU if available) + preprocessing with OpenCV.

Alternative (CPU-only, simpler):
â†’ Tesseract + OCRmyPDF (automates best practices, but slower).

If you need custom training (specific fonts, structured docs):
â†’ PaddleOCR or Calamari with fine-tuning.
